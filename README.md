# Stack-and-queue

1.Design a stack using a single queue as an instance variable, and only constant additional local memory within the method bodies.

2.Â Suppose you have a stack S containing n elements and a queue Q that is initially empty. Write function that use Q to scan S to see 
if it contains a certain element x, with the additional constraint that your algorithm must return the elements back to S in their original order. You may use S, Q and a constant number of other variables.

3.Design a queue using two stacks as instance variables, such that all queue operations execute in amortized O(1) time
